# --- NEW ADDITIONS FOR THIS PROJECT ---

# Docker-related artifacts (build context, volumes)
.docker/             # Docker buildkit cache or other local Docker files
# For named volumes like db_data and redis_data, Docker typically manages them outside the repo,
# but if Docker creates any local directories on your host due to volume mounts that aren't fully managed
# (e.g., if a volume path like `./db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data` causes a db_data/ folder on your host)
# you should ignore them:
# db_data/
# redis_data/

# Data Ingestion Service specific generated data
# The 'data' folder under apps/data-ingestion-service should contain
# incoming, processed, and error CSVs, which are typically not committed.


# TypeScript compilation artifacts
*.tsbuildinfo # Incremental build information for TypeScript

# IDE-specific files (e.g., VS Code workspace settings if user-specific)
# Generally, .vscode/ is often committed for team consistency,
# but if you have highly personal settings, you might add:
# .vscode/
# Or more granular:
# .vscode/*.code-workspace
# .vscode/*.code-profile
/apps/data-ingestion-service/data
